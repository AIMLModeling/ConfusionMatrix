# ConfusionMatrix
A Confusion matrix is an N x N matrix used for evaluating the performance of a classification model, where N is the number of target classes. The matrix compares the actual target values with those predicted by the machine learning model. This gives us a holistic view of how well our classification model is performing and what kinds of errors it is making. I explained the concepts of confusion matrix and its measurements for evaluation. Also I demonstrated how to calculate confusion matrix in Python.
